        Hydrogen Line Telescope

      <div class="info">
        In early 2020 I found out that something that I thought was totally impossible was, actually, possible! My idea of a radio telescope was a super huge money sucking machine that a university could barely run, but as it turns out, that is not true. Through online forums, I came across a device called a SDR - a cheap $10 radio reciever that is orders of magnitude better (cost, size, frequency range, bandwidth) than a normal home radio, along with super cheap amplifiers only buildable due to recent continuation of Moore's law.
After much procastination, I finally got going - building one test telescope with an old satellite dish that didn't work, mostly due to garbage construction, by me, of the feedhorn -- the catcher that the dish focuses the incoming signal into. After a redesign, I used a much easier to work with dish designed for wifi reception, and with that, I managed to detect an interstellar signal emitted by hydrogen atoms in the galatic plane.
